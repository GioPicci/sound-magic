# Simulations
Here I will upload every sound-related simulation.

Right now you can download my project named "SimulazioneOnde", a software created with Processing( a Java-like programming language).
The only thing you need to make it work is the Processing Developing Enviroment that you can download right from the Processing official site.

But what does this simulation do?
The program is able to simulate the behaviour of sound in a particular 3D enviroment (a cubic room)
